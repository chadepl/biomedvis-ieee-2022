# Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS

This repository contains the code and the data I used for my submission to the [Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS](http://biovis.net/2022/biovisChallenges_vis/).

A working demo of the proposed visualization system, the ProtoFold Neighborhood Inspector, can be found at [this](https://teal-taiyaki-9c0076.netlify.app/) link.
