## Data description

"Decoration layers" in protein site modification:
- post-translational modifications (what we want to identify)
- in vivo artifacts: chemicals that attach to proteins, changing their behavior.
- in vitro artifacts: changes induced in processing steps.

Data generation technique is mass spectrometry (MS).

### Test data 

- `n_cols`: 9
- `n_rows`: 6880

Attributes:
- `UniAcc` (str): identifier of modified loci (row identifier).
- `RES` (str): aminoacids. 
- `POS` (int): position in the aminoacid
- `MOD` (str):
- `Entry` (str): `Gene` + `Species`
- `Gene` (str): protein identifier.
- `Species` (str): either human or mouse
- `classification` (): type of change (for example post-translational vs artifact).
- `PathogenicMutation` ():

Some useful information:
- C (c): carbon atom
- C-alpha (ca): central carbon atom. Four different groups are attached to this atom: amino group (NH2), carboxylic acid group (COOH), hydrogen (H), side-chain R which varies per aminoacid.
  - "When describing a protein, which is a chain of amino acids, one often approximates the location of each amino acid as the location of its Î±-carbon." [L1]
- C-beta (cb): secondary carbon atom which might separate functional groups. For instance, could separate amino group (NH2) from the carboxylic acid group (COOH) [L2]
- N (n): nitrogen atom
- Protein structure can be [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_primary_structure), [secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure), [tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tertiary_structure) and [quaternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quaternary_structure) [L3]
