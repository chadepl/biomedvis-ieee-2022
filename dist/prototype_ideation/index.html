    <p>We have also created prototypes for individual parts of the GUI concept. These can be found in the following links:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="widgets_prototypes/structure_vis/index.html">Structure vis</a></li>
        <li><a href="widgets_prototypes/single_neighborhood/index.html">Single neighborhood analysis</a></li>
        <li><a href="widgets_prototypes/multiple_neighborhood/index.html">Multiple neighborhood analysis</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Based on the exploration of the dataset, the user goals and the usage scenarios, we first sketched some ideas for GUI.</p>

    <p>We have iterated the prototype and now have a GUI that we will proceed to implement. The blueprint is below.</p>
